# first test: do concat of volar and dorsal to have a baseline only with coupled transforms and only use volar for seeds
# second test: use two FEs and concat shape codes with only coupled transforms and only use volar for seeds
# third test: use two FEs and concat shape codes with Encoupled transforms and only use volar for seeds <- make it gradually harder (offset -> rotation etc.)


# concat volar+dorsal without any augmentation -> get shape code -> generate seeds using shape code and only volar points -> best possible outcome if volar and dorsal sides cannot be aligned
# two FEs (volar and dorsal) -> two shape codes -> generate seeds using both shape codes

# rotate volar side independent from gt and then reverse the rotation to get the gt using the saved transforms
# make network use dorsal side by encoding rotation of gt in dorsal side
# generate seeds using volar side. Register seeds to dorsal side using.
